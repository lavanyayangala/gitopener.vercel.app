# Open Source
 
 1. Open source can be described as for suppose if we are working on a large , medium , small projects in an organization or project form 
  
     which involves large code so due to human nature we may make mistakes or some errors which leads to complications.
 
 
 2. We can make it available to public using platforms like Github which promotes collaboration and can find solutions in ease by community collaboration.
 
 
 3. Here public audience can collaborate and rectify the mistakes if found and can make a pull request with changes suggested if it resolves 
    
    the problem and after checking code efficiency we can push to main branch if it works.
 
 
 4. Here collaboration also improves along with chances of profile visibility and we can be part of knowledge sharing as part of our contribution which
     
     adds value in long run and also promotes working on code.
 
 
 5. Open source collaborations in the form of Code and Non Code play a significant role in a project.
 
 
 6. Here we can use open source opportunity using version control systems like Github.
